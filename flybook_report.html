<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 1 - Privilege Abuse</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use strong authentication and
authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables
a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 2 - Excessive Allocation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Limit the amount of resources that are
accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious.
Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input.
Consider uniformly throttling all requests in order to make it more
difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be
freed. Use resource-limiting settings, if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 3 - Encryption Brute Forcing</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Low</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use commonly accepted algorithms and
recommended key sizes. The key size used will depend on how important it
is to keep the data confidential and for how long.In theory a brute
force attack performing an exhaustive key space search will always
succeed, so the goal is to have computational security. Moore's law
needs to be taken into account that suggests that computing resources
double every eighteen months.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 4 - Audit Log Manipulation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use Principle of Least Privilege to
avoid unauthorized access to log files leading to manipulation/injection
on those files. Do not allow tainted data to be written in the log file
without prior input validation. Whitelisting may be used to properly
validate the data. Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.
Use static analysis tool to identify log forging vulnerabilities. Avoid
viewing logs with tools that may interpret control characters in the
file, such as command-line shells.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 5 - Overflow Buffers</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use a language or compiler that
performs automatic bounds checking. Use secure functions not vulnerable
to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure
that you do boundary checking. Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as
StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless
this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.
Utilize static source code analysis tools to identify potential buffer
overflow weaknesses in the software.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 6 - Authentication Abuse/ByPass</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use strong authentication and
authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables
a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 7 - Double Encoding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Assume all input is malicious. Create a
white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on
the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the
white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your
decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of
alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP
address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms,
avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form
data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use
the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur
after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do
not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding
process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation
process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can
be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL
requests if the regular expression is too restrictive. There are tools
to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from
Microsoft
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx).</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 8 - Privilege Abuse</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use strong authentication and
authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables
a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 9 - Buffer Manipulation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: To help protect an application from
buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be
leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider
using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability
of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen
language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider
using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer
manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make
sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are
often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice
and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and
protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating
system level preventative functionality that can be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 10 - Flooding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Ensure that protocols have specific
limits of scale configured. Specify expectations for capabilities and
dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches
limits. Uniformly throttle all requests in order to make it more
difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be
freed.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 11 - Excessive Allocation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Limit the amount of resources that are
accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious.
Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input.

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 12 - Format String Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Limit the usage of formatting string
functions. Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be
validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 13 - Client-side Injection-induced Buffer
Overflow</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: The client software should not install
untrusted code from a non-authenticated server. The client software
should have the latest patches and should be audited for vulnerabilities
before being used to communicate with potentially hostile servers.
Perform input validation for length of buffer inputs. Use a language or
compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Use an abstraction
library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the
Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds
checking, it is not a complete solution. Ensure all buffer uses are
consistently bounds-checked. Use OS-level preventative functionality.

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 14 - Command Delimiters</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Perform whitelist validation
against a positive specification for command length, type, and
parameters.Design: Limit program privileges, so if commands circumvent
program input validation or filter routines then commands do not running
under a privileged accountImplementation: Perform input validation for
all remote content.Implementation: Use type conversions such as JDBC

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 16 - Dictionary-based Password Attack</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Create a strong password policy and
ensure that your system enforces this policy.Implement an intelligent
password throttling mechanism. Care must be taken to assure that these
mechanisms do not excessively enable account lockout attacks such as
CAPEC-02.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 18 - iFrame Overlay</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Configuration: Disable iFrames in the
Web browser.Operation: When maintaining an authenticated session with a
privileged target system, do not use the same browser to navigate to
unfamiliar sites to perform other activities. Finish working with the
target system and logout first before proceeding to other
tasks.Operation: If using the Firefox browser, use the NoScript plug-in
that will help forbid iFrames.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 19 - File Content Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Enforce principle of least
privilegeDesign: Validate all input for content including files. Ensure
that if files and remote content must be accepted that once accepted,
they are placed in a sandbox type location so that lower assurance
clients cannot write up to higher assurance processes (like Web server
processes for example)Design: Execute programs with constrained
privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities.
Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory
are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote
execution.Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications
are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding
to server host.Implementation: Virus scanning on hostImplementation:
Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and
processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a
security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic
activities can begin.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 20 - Privilege Escalation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Very carefully manage the setting,
management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in
the software. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning
access rights to entities in a software system. Implement separation of
privilege - Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting
access to a system resource.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 22 - Catching exception throw/signal from
privileged block</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Application Architects must be careful
to design callback, signal, and similar asynchronous constructs such
that they shed excess privilege prior to handing control to user-written
(thus untrusted) code.Application Architects must be careful to design
privileged code blocks such that upon return (successful, failed, or
unpredicted) that privilege is shed prior to leaving the
block/scope.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 23 - Filter Failure through Buffer
Overflow</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Make sure that ANY failure occurring in
the filtering or input validation routine is properly handled and that
offending input is NOT allowed to go through. Basically make sure that
the vault is closed when failure occurs.Pre-design: Use a language or
compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.Pre-design through

<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Use libraries and templates
that minimize unfiltered input.Implementation: Normalize, filter and
white list all input including that which is not expected to have any
scripting content.Implementation: The victim should configure the
browser to minimize active content from untrusted sources.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 27 - XSS Targeting URI Placeholders</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Use browser technologies that
do not allow client side scripting.Design: Utilize strict type,
character, and encoding enforcement.Implementation: Ensure all content
that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content
specification.Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client
is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must
canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.Implementation:
Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and
user-generated contentImplementation: Perform output validation for all
remote content.Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as
JavaScript in browserImplementation: Patching software. There are many
attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many
vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and
plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with
XSS countermeasures mitigates this.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 30 - Command Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: All user-controllable input should be
validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters. Whitelisting
input is desired, but if a blacklisting approach is necessary, then
focusing on command related terms and delimiters is necessary.Input
should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related
characters are not treated as part of the command. For example,
quotation characters may need to be encoded so that the application does
not treat the quotation as a delimiter.Input should be parameterized, or
restricted to data sections of a command, thus removing the chance that
the input will be treated as part of the command itself.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 31 - XML Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Strong input validation - All
user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal
characters as well as content that can be interpreted in the context of
an XML data or a query. Use of custom error pages - Attackers can glean
information about the nature of queries from descriptive error messages.
Input validation must be coupled with customized error pages that inform
about an error without disclosing information about the database or
application.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 32 - Remote Code Inclusion</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Minimize attacks by input validation
and sanitization of any user data that will be used by the target
application to locate a remote file to be included.</p>
<p><strong>References</strong>:
https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/253.html</p>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 33 - Leverage Alternate Encoding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Assume all input might use an improper
representation. Use canonicalized data inside the application; all data
must be converted into the representation used inside the application
(UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.)Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list
that defines all valid input to the software system based on the
requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white
list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your
decoding process against malicious input.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 34 - Schema Poisoning</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Protect the schema against
unauthorized modification.Implementation: For applications that use a
known schema, use a local copy or a known good repository instead of the
schema reference supplied in the schema document.Implementation: For
applications that leverage remote schemas, use the HTTPS protocol to
prevent modification of traffic in transit and to avoid unauthorized
modification.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 35 - Session Hijacking - ClientSide</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Properly encrypt and sign identity
tokens in transit, and use industry standard session key generation
mechanisms that utilize high amount of entropy to generate the session
key. Many standard web and application servers will perform this task on
your behalf. Utilize a session timeout for all sessions. If the user
does not explicitly logout, terminate their session after this period of
inactivity. If the user logs back in then a new session key should be
generated.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 36 - Argument Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Do not program input values
directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until
proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it
to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out
all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.Design: Limit
program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 38 - Cross Site Request Forgery</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use cryptographic tokens to associate a
request with a specific action. The token can be regenerated at every
request so that if a request with an invalid token is encountered, it
can be reliably discarded. The token is considered invalid if it arrived
with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated
with.Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer
header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was
actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current
context.Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action
every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked.
This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a
malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to
recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied
to using a second factor of authentication before performing such
actions.In general, every request must be checked for the appropriate
authentication token as well as authorization in the current session
context.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 41 - Double Encoding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Assume all input is malicious. Create a
white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on
the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the
white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your
decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of
alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP
address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms,
avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form
data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use
the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur
after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do
not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding
process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation
process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can
be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL
requests if the regular expression is too restrictive. There are tools
to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from
Microsoft
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx).</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 43 - Buffer Manipulation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: To help protect an application from
buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be
leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider
using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability
of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen
language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider
using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer
manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make
sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are
often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice
and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and
protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating
system level preventative functionality that can be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: All user-controllable input should be
validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters. Whitelisting
input is desired, but if a blacklisting approach is necessary, then
focusing on command related terms and delimiters is necessary.Input
should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related
characters are not treated as part of the command. For example,
quotation characters may need to be encoded so that the application does
not treat the quotation as a delimiter.Input should be parameterized, or
restricted to data sections of a command, thus removing the chance that
the input will be treated as part of the command itself.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 77 - Buffer Manipulation</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: To help protect an application from
buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be
leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider
using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability
of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen
language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider
using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer
manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make
sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are
often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice
and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and
protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating
system level preventative functionality that can be applied.</p>

<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: All user-controllable input should be
validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters. Whitelisting
input is desired, but if a blacklisting approach is necessary, then
focusing on command related terms and delimiters is necessary.Input
should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related
characters are not treated as part of the command. For example,
quotation characters may need to be encoded so that the application does
not treat the quotation as a delimiter.Input should be parameterized, or
restricted to data sections of a command, thus removing the chance that
the input will be treated as part of the command itself.</p>

<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Properly encrypt and sign identity
tokens in transit, and use industry standard session key generation
mechanisms that utilize high amount of entropy to generate the session
key. Many standard web and application servers will perform this task on
your behalf. Utilize a session timeout for all sessions. If the user
does not explicitly logout, terminate their session after this period of
inactivity. If the user logs back in then a new session key should be
generated.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 104 - Argument Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Do not program input values
directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until
proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it
to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out
all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.Design: Limit
program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent
program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it
is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox
for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an
attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has
occurred.Implementation: Implement an audit log that is written to a
separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to
provide evidence and details of the compromise.</p>

communication between the client and server. For instance it is best
practice to use SSL to mitigate man in the middle attack.Do not code
send session ID with GET method, otherwise the session ID will be copied
to the URL. In general avoid writing session IDs in the URLs. URLs can
get logged in log files, which are vulnerable to an attacker.Encrypt the
session data associated with the session ID.Use multifactor
authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 106 - Cross Site Request Forgery</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use cryptographic tokens to associate a
request with a specific action. The token can be regenerated at every
request so that if a request with an invalid token is encountered, it
can be reliably discarded. The token is considered invalid if it arrived
with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated
with.Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer
header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was
actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current
context.Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action
every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked.
This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a
malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to
recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied
to using a second factor of authentication before performing such
actions.In general, every request must be checked for the appropriate
authentication token as well as authorization in the current session
context.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 109 - Double Encoding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Assume all input is malicious. Create a
white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on
the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the
white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your
decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of
alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP
address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms,
avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form
data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use
the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur
after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do
not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding
process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation
process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can
be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL
requests if the regular expression is too restrictive. There are tools
to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from
Microsoft

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 121 - File Content Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Enforce principle of least
privilegeDesign: Validate all input for content including files. Ensure
that if files and remote content must be accepted that once accepted,
they are placed in a sandbox type location so that lower assurance
clients cannot write up to higher assurance processes (like Web server
processes for example)Design: Execute programs with constrained
privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities.
Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory
are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote
execution.Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications
are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding
to server host.Implementation: Virus scanning on hostImplementation:
Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and
processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a
security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic
activities can begin.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 132 - Command Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: All user-controllable input should be
validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters. Whitelisting
input is desired, but if a blacklisting approach is necessary, then
focusing on command related terms and delimiters is necessary.Input
should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related
characters are not treated as part of the command. For example,
quotation characters may need to be encoded so that the application does
not treat the quotation as a delimiter.Input should be parameterized, or
restricted to data sections of a command, thus removing the chance that
the input will be treated as part of the command itself.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 133 - XML Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Strong input validation - All
user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal
characters as well as content that can be interpreted in the context of
an XML data or a query. Use of custom error pages - Attackers can glean
information about the nature of queries from descriptive error messages.
Input validation must be coupled with customized error pages that inform
about an error without disclosing information about the database or
application.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 135 - Leverage Alternate Encoding</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Assume all input might use an improper
representation. Use canonicalized data inside the application; all data
must be converted into the representation used inside the application
(UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.)Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list
that defines all valid input to the software system based on the
requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white
list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your
decoding process against malicious input.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 136 - Schema Poisoning</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Protect the schema against
unauthorized modification.Implementation: For applications that use a
known schema, use a local copy or a known good repository instead of the
schema reference supplied in the schema document.Implementation: For
applications that leverage remote schemas, use the HTTPS protocol to
prevent modification of traffic in transit and to avoid unauthorized
modification.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 137 - Session Hijacking - ClientSide</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Properly encrypt and sign identity
tokens in transit, and use industry standard session key generation
mechanisms that utilize high amount of entropy to generate the session
key. Many standard web and application servers will perform this task on
your behalf. Utilize a session timeout for all sessions. If the user
does not explicitly logout, terminate their session after this period of
inactivity. If the user logs back in then a new session key should be
generated.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 138 - Argument Injection</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Design: Do not program input values
directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until
proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it
to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out
all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.Design: Limit
program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent
program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it
is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox
for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an
attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has
occurred.Implementation: Implement an audit log that is written to a
separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to
provide evidence and details of the compromise.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 139 - Reusing Session IDs (aka Session
Replay) - ClientSide</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Always invalidate a session ID after
the user logout.Setup a session time out for the session IDs.Protect the
communication between the client and server. For instance it is best
practice to use SSL to mitigate man in the middle attack.Do not code
send session ID with GET method, otherwise the session ID will be copied
to the URL. In general avoid writing session IDs in the URLs. URLs can
get logged in log files, which are vulnerable to an attacker.Encrypt the
session data associated with the session ID.Use multifactor
authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Threat</strong>: 140 - Cross Site Request Forgery</p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Very High</p>
<p><strong>Mitigations</strong>: Use cryptographic tokens to associate a
request with a specific action. The token can be regenerated at every
request so that if a request with an invalid token is encountered, it
can be reliably discarded. The token is considered invalid if it arrived
with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated
with.Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer
header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was
actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current
context.Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action
every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked.
This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a
malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to
recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied
to using a second factor of authentication before performing such
actions.In general, every request must be checked for the appropriate
authentication token as well as authorization in the current session
context.</p>
